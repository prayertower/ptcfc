Prayer Tower Christian Fellowship Centre (PTCFC) is a church modelled after the ministry of Paul as per the instructions or command of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; recorded in the book of Matthew 28:18-20 “And Jesus came and said unto them, saying All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen”.

                        Our Vision is to win people out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light, and to equip (train) the saints (believers) to do the work of the ministry."For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves," <b>Colossians 1:13</b>

                        We value and live a life of Love. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. ... Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as Christ God forgave you. — Ephesians 4:32. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.

                        <p>
                        We emphasized the importance of fellowship. Acts 2:42 "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers." In the early church, "day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people"

                        <p>
                        God is the one who draws men to Him for salvation. He is the One who wins souls. We continually ask Him to create in us the desire to witness and the courage to do so. We can ask God to make this truth real to us and to give us His love for all men.

                        <p>
                        The pursuit of excellence is a matter of choosing what is best or superior because it will better enable us to accomplish what God has designed us to be and do. “That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ…” (Philippians 1:10)

                        <h6>Loyalty</h6>

                        <p>
                        As people we long to have friends and family who are on our side no matter what we do because we were created to be in relationship with a God who does just that. Our desire for undying loyalty stems from our need to be in a relationship with the God who would die out of loyalty and love for us.

                        <p>
                        "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ …" (Romans 8:16–17). Becoming a Christian means being adopted into God's family as a child of God and brother or sister to fellow believers. This understanding explains why we refer to the church as a family

                        <h6>THE BIBLE</h6>
                        <p>
                        We believe that the Bible is the written Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and completely truthful in all it affirms. It bears witness to Jesus Christ, the Living Word and is infallible in its purposes. While reason, experience, and tradition together with the Bible serve to inform truth and life, the Scriptures are the primary authority in the rule of faith and practice. (II Timothy 3:16-17; I Peter 1:23-25; Hebrews 4:12)

                        <p>
                        We believe in one God, creator of all things, who has revealed Himself in three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These three are one in eternity, deity, and purpose; everlasting, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness. (Genesis 12:33; Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalms 90:2; Psalms 102:27; I Timothy 1:17; John 1:1-2; John 8:58; Heb. 1:8; I John 1:2; Micah 5:2; Revelation 1:8; Hebrews 9:14; Romans 1:20)

                        </h6>
                        <p>
                         We believe in the incarnation and virgin birth of Jesus Christ who came into the  world to reveal the Father, and was the reflection of His glory and the express image of the Father; that Jesus Christ, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, was the Creator of all things. We  further believe that in Christ dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, that He was very God and very Man, and that He is our savior, the one perfect mediator between God and humanity. We acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord over all things in heaven and in earth, and under the earth.  (John 1:1-2, 14; I Timothy 3:16; Acts 7:37-38; Hebrews 1:1-5; Philippians 2:9-10)

                        </h6>
                        <p>
                        We believe in Jesus Christ’s sinless life, mira-cles, substitutionary death, bodily resurrection and His ascension into Heaven. He will return in power and glory to judge all people. As His return may occur at any moment, the believer’s response is joy-ous expectation, watchfulness, and diligence. We anticipate His return at which time there will  be a new heaven and a new earth, a resurrection of those who are lost to eternal death and those  who are saved to eternal life, and the enemies of Christ will be subdued and the reign of God will  be established. (Acts 1:11, 3:19-21; Daniel 7:14; Revelation 20:4; Revelation 14:6, 21:3-8, 22:1-5, 17)
